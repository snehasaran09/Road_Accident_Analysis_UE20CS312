# Road Accident Anlysis of Severity Per Vehicle Type 

The primary goal of this project is to use statistical analysis methods such as multiple linear regression to gain insights into the road accidents depending on the vehicle type, state and their injury measure. Using data obtained from the government website a comparison between state groups is performed using the standardized regression coefficients to check for contrasts between different types of vehicles. Analysis of these variables on a macroeconomic scale is imperative in order to gain insight on the current scenario, and to see if improvements in any sector would lead to monumental change and growth overall.The aim of this paper is to identify the major vehicles that cause fatal road accidents to two wheeler vehicles and 4 wheeler vehicles.
 
The dataset taken from the government webiste in India , https://data.gov.in/ consists of all the states , the vehicle type and the severity of the accident caused. 

In this project we perform the pre-processing of data and do the explanatory data analysis of the dataset to figure out the vehicles that contain the most amount of correlation with FATAL CAR/JEEP and 2 WHEELER accidents.

Based on this , the fllowing Multiple Linear Regression models were built : 
1. Fatal motor vehicle accidents that are caused by tempos/tractors

2. Fatal motor vehicle accidents caused by truck/lorries

3. Fatal car/jeep/van accidents caused by buses

4. Fatal car/jeep/van accidents caused by trucks/lorries
